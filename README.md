## Functionality

This app uses **Pagination** **Filtering** and **Sorting**
With this app you can filter through a list of employees choosing either math or female employees.
The sorting method will sort employees in ascending and descending order.
This app will also show you how many employees are in your current table based on your filtered methods.

## Technologies used

- React.JS
- Bootstrap
- lodash
  _axios_

## DevNote

During development this app was originally utilizing the _randomUserAPI_ with _axios_ and while in the process of building this application the api went down for a few days so I ended up just creating a mock database of random employees. In the future i may update this application to use the _randomUserApi_.
